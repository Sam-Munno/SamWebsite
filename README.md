This project was written in Angular. I deployed the code on S3, then exposed my own DNS (sammunno.tk) on route 53. I used CloudWatch and Certificate Manager to ensure https requests. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
